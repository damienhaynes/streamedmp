About StreamedMP Skin
=====================
Streamed MP is a port of Team Razorfishes skin Mediastream created for XBMC, over to the popular open source HTPC Application MediaPortal. StreamedMP is a close port, however there are some new views/layouts included with the skin that will keep the fanart fans happy. This skin has also been designed with ease of use in mind, with a custom menu generator included to make creating menus suited to your setup extremely easy. All of this is wrapped up in a nice installer that also installs the latest versions of very popular plugins [MP TV-Series](https://github.com/damienhaynes/mptvseries), [Moving-Pictures](https://github.com/damienhaynes/moving-pictures) and [Trakt](https://github.com/trakt/Trakt-for-Mediaportal).
