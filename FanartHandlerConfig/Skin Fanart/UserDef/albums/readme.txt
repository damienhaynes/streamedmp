MediaPoral Fanart Handler plugin uses any fanart that you add to this folder.

These fanarts will be displayed when playing music to a particular album. 
Files should be named by mask: Artist-Album (any numbers).jpg

Using the names of artists and albums sign "-" is unacceptable. Replace them with a space. 
Ie for the artist In-Grid album Best of 1990-1995 file will be named: In Grid-Best of 1990 1995 (1).jpg
